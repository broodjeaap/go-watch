# Todo
- add last/next run of watch to front page
    - ability to pause watches?
- refactor everything under the Web struct ?
    - init func that calls:
        - func to set routes
        - func to set pages
        - func to init crons, track watch.name -> cron id
- refactor getFilterResult so it's just part of web ?
- add timer to run watch ?
